## Overview of Project

### Overview of the analysis

 * The purpose of the analysis was two fold. The first part of the analysis was to determine the total rides per city type, as well as avg fare per ride in each city type and the avg fare each driver made per city type. The second part of the analysis was to determine the total weekly fares for each city type and then to represent it into a graph to better show the discrepencies between city types.


## Results

 * Over View Deliverable 1
		-  Deliverable one centeres around creating a summary chart by city type. In this summary there is total rides, total drivers, total fares, avg fare per ride and avg fare per driver. 

		- what we see is the data is skewed heavily for the urban city type, followed by suburban and finally urban. this makes sense because youre most dence populations are in the urban community. 

		- however we also see that urban city type is lowest for avg fare per ride and avg fare per driver. the distances drivin in urban communities is less that the distances driven in suburban or rural ares, which in turns leads to a smaller fare per ride and driver.

 * Overview Deliverable 2 
	   	- Deliverable two was conducted to see weekly fares by date for each city type. here we used a graphical representation to show again the discrepency between Urban total fares and rural and suburban total fares over a 4 month period. 

	   	- This stays consistent with Deliverable one in showing that urban ride shareing is much more prevelent then outside the urban centers.

### Summary

	* How this data can be used by the CEO is to figure out what city type to implement more ride sharing programs, you can see that the scheer volume favours Urban cities, however if your strategy is to make more per ride and driver, then Rural areas are more in line with what the data is showing. The data was cleaned of any NaN values and was a true representation of the actual fare data by city type. analyzing the data we can clearly see urban City types by the total fares, rides, drivers and weekly totals favours the Urban centers
